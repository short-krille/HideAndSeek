## Overview

HideAndSeek is a Minecraft minigame plugin in which one team hides while the other seeks. Hiders can disguise themselves
as blocks, shrink to a tiny size, or simply rely on good hiding spots, while seekers use a diverse arsenal of utility
items to track, reveal, and eliminate them. The plugin is built on top of MinigameFramework (also developed by me),
which handles phase management, team assignment, and item registration.

The plugin supports custom maps with per-map setting overrides, a lobby voting system for maps and game modes, a
persistent loadout and cosmetic skin system, and an extensive in-game settings GUI provided by MinigameFramework.

## Game Modes

| Mode     | Description                                                                                                            |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `NORMAL` | Hiders hide in the map as themselves. Seekers hunt them down using their sword and utility items.                      |
| `BLOCK`  | Hiders disguise as configurable blocks and blend into the scenery. Seekers must spot inconsistencies.                  |
| `SMALL`  | Hiders are scaled down to a configurable size, making them much harder to spot. Seekers can optionally be resized too. |

Game modes can be changed via the in-game settings GUI or voted on by players in the lobby.

## Requirements

| Requirement       | Version |
|-------------------|---------|
| Java              | 21+     |
| Paper (or Purpur) | 1.21.x  |
| MinigameFramework | 1.0.0   |

### MinigameFramework

> [!IMPORTANT]
> HideAndSeek depends on **MinigameFramework**, a companion library also developed by me. **It is not currently publicly
available, neither the JAR nor the source code.**.

> [!NOTE]
> MinigameFramework will be released publicly in the future. This section will be updated when that happens.

---

## Installation

1. Ensure your server runs Paper 1.21.x with Java 21 or newer.
2. Wait until `MinigameFramework.jar` is released and place it in your `plugins/` folder.
3. Place `HideAndSeek-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` in your `plugins/` folder.
4. Start the server once to generate config files.
5. Set up at least two scoreboard teams via MinigameFramework's team configuration.
6. Add at least one map (see [Map Setup](#map-setup)).
   7.. Restart the server.

### Quick Checklist

- [ ] Java 21+ on the server
- [ ] Paper 1.21.x server jar
- [ ] `MinigameFramework.jar` in `plugins/`
- [ ] `HideAndSeek-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` in `plugins/`
- [ ] Two teams configured in MinigameFramework
- [ ] At least one map entry in `plugins/HideAndSeek/maps.yml`
- [ ] Server restarted after first run

---

## Configuration

The plugin generates `config.yml` and `maps.yml` in `plugins/HideAndSeek/` on first run.

### How settings work

All gameplay settings are managed through the **in-game settings GUI**, provided by MinigameFramework. The `config.yml`
file only serves to override the default value of a setting. If a setting is not present in `config.yml`, the plugin's
built-in default is used instead. Changes made in the GUI take effect imassets/clipstely but do **NOT** persist across
restarts.

### Top-level config keys

```yaml
# Hide & Seek Plugin Configuration

# List of available map world names
# These must match the world names in maps.yml
maps:
  - "map1"
  - "map2"

# NOTE: Map-specific configuration (spawn-points, allowed-blocks, world-borders, preferred-modes)
# is saved in maps.yml. See that file for per-map settings.

# Global disallowed blockstate properties
# Properties listed here won't appear in the appearance GUI for ANY block
disallowed-blockstates:
  - "waterlogged"
  - "conditional"

seeker-break-blocks:
  - "SHORT_GRASS"
  - "TALL_GRASS"
  - "SEAGRASS"
  - "TALL_SEAGRASS"

block-interaction-exceptions:
  - "*_DOOR"
  - "*_FENCE_GATE"
  - "*_TRAPDOOR"
  - "*_BUTTON"
  - "*_LEVER"

block-physics-exceptions:
  - "*_DOOR"
  - "*_FENCE_GATE"
  - "*_TRAPDOOR"
  - "*_BUTTON"
  - "*_LEVER"

nms:
  # Master switch: attempt to load NMS adapter. If true, plugin will try to enable NMS features
  # on startup. If adapter missing or fails, behavior depends on fallbacks.
  enabled: true

  # Game settings
game:
  # Apply player facing direction to placed blockstate in BLOCK mode
  # true = align facing/axis/rotation/half with player look
  # false = keep the chosen blockstate exactly as selected in the appearance GUI
  apply-player-direction: true

  # Maximum air blocks above water/lava that still allow hiding placement
  max-air-above-liquid: 2

persistence:
  save-skin-data: true
  save-loadout-data: true

settings:
# Leave this section empty to use plugins defaults. To override a specific
# default value for a setting, add the key under this node and set the desired value. For example:
#  hider-items:
#    random-block:
#      uses: 10
#  game:
#    use_map_specific_setting_overrides: true
# This will set the default value for the random-block setting to 10. Though this still can be changed in the
# ingame settings menu.
```

### Overriding setting defaults

Any setting shown in the in-game GUI can have its default value overridden in `config.yml` under the `settings:` key.
For example:

```yaml
settings:
  game.mode: BLOCK
  game.hiding-time: 90
  game.seeking-time: 240
  game.hiders.health: 10
  anticheat.seeking.visibility-range: 16.0
  loadout.hider-max-items: 4
  loadout.hider-max-tokens: 14
  hider-items.speed-boost.cooldown: 15
  seeker-items.glowing-compass.cooldown: 30
  points.hider.survival.amount: 10
```

A full list of available setting keys can be found in [
`SettingRegisterer.java`](plugin/src/main/java/de/thecoolcraft11/hideAndSeek/util/setting/SettingRegisterer.java).

---

## Map Setup

Maps are defined in `plugins/HideAndSeek/maps.yml`. Each key is the internal map name and must match the name of a world
folder present on the server.

```yaml

# Note: If spawn-points and world-borders have equal counts, they are matched by index
# Example: Spawn 1 → Border 1, Spawn 2 → Border 2, etc.
# If counts are different, all spawns will use the first border.

# Configuration patterns for allowed-blocks:
# - Simple material:                 "STONE", "DIRT"
# - All variants (e.g., all candles): "*CANDLE{RED_CANDLE}"  (shows RED_CANDLE in selector, all colors in appearance GUI)
# - All blockstates:                  "OAK_LOG[*]"  (allows all axis rotations)
# - Specific properties allowed:      "CANDLE[lit,candles]"  (only lit & candles customizable)

### Block Pattern Syntax

The `allowed-blocks` list accepts a pattern DSL for flexible block selection:

| Pattern                        | Meaning                                                   |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `STONE`                        | Exactly the `STONE` material                              |
| `OAK_SLAB[type=bottom]`        | Oak slab locked to a specific block state                 |
| `OAK_SLAB[*]`                  | Oak slab with any block state allowed                     |
| `*SLAB{OAK_SLAB}`              | All slab variants, defaulting to Oak Slab                 |
| `*SLAB{OAK_SLAB}[type=bottom]` | All slab variants, default Oak Slab, locked block state   |
| `#planks{OAK_PLANKS}`          | All blocks in the `planks` Bukkit tag, default Oak Planks |
| `{STONE,GRANITE,DIORITE}`      | Explicit custom material list                             |

---

## Loadout System

Players configure their loadout in the lobby before each round. Each item has a rarity that determines its token cost.

| Rarity    | Default Token Cost |
|-----------|--------------------|
| Common    | 1                  |
| Uncommon  | 2                  |
| Rare      | 4                  |
| Epic      | 6                  |
| Legendary | 10                 |

By default, hiders have 12 tokens and up to 3 item slots. Seekers have 12 tokens and up to 4 item slots. All values are
configurable via the in-game settings GUI or under `settings.loadout.*` in `config.yml`.

## NMS Features

The plugin loads a version-specific NMS adapter at startup via `NmsLoader`. Items and features that depend on NMS either
disable themselves entirely or fall back to vanilla behavior: the plugin always starts and runs normally regardless.

| Capability                                                       | Behaviour without NMS                                                         |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Client gamemode spoofing (appear in survival while in spectator) | Ghost Essence falls back to limited behaviour                                 |
| Mob pathfinding API                                              | Ghost Essence falls back; Seeker's Assistant is disabled                      |
| Client camera entity spoofing                                    | Camera item is disabled entirely                                              |

The current NMS implementation targets **Paper 1.21.x** (`nms-v1_21_R7`). Adding support for another version requires a
new Gradle module implementing the `NmsAdapter` interface.

## Project Structure

The repository is a multi-module Gradle project:

```
HideAndSeek/
├── plugin/          # Core plugin logic: items, phases, GUIs, listeners, commands
├── nms/             # NMS API module: NmsAdapter interface, NmsLoader, NoopNmsAdapter fallback
├── nms-v1_21_R7/    # Version-specific NMS implementation for Paper 1.21.x
├── build.gradle     # Root build file
└── settings.gradle  # Module declarations
```

The `nms` module defines the `NmsAdapter` interface and a `NoopNmsAdapter` that provides safe no-op fallbacks. The
`nms-v1_21_R7` module contains the live implementation including the custom `SeekerAssistantEntity` and its AI goal
classes. The `plugin` module depends on both and is bundled into a single shadow JAR at build time.

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- Java 21 JDK
- Git
- `MinigameFramework.jar`: **not publicly available**; will be released soon

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheCoolcraft11/HideAndSeek.git
   cd HideAndSeek
   ```

2. Install `MinigameFramework.jar` into your local Maven cache so Gradle can resolve it. Replace the version with
   whatever the author provides:
   ```bash
   mvn install:install-file \
   -Dfile=/path/to/MinigameFramework.jar \
   -DgroupId=de.thecoolcraft11 \
   -DartifactId=minigameframework \
   -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT \
   -Dpackaging=jar
   ``` 
   (Linux/Mac)

   ```cmd
   mvn install:install-file
    -Dfile=C:\path\to\MinigameFramework.jar
    -DgroupId=de.thecoolcraft11 -DartifactId=minigameframework 
   -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT 
   -Dpackaging=jar
    ```
   (Windows)

3. Build the plugin:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew shadowJar
   ```
   On Windows:
   ```bash
   gradlew.bat shadowJar
   ```

4. The output JAR will be at:
   ```
   plugin/build/libs/HideAndSeek-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```

5. Copy the JAR to your server's `plugins/` directory alongside `MinigameFramework.jar`.
